# Appointment Scheduler
### The technologies used are:
1. Dialogflow for Natural Language Understanding
2. NodeJS as backend
3. Airtable as Database
4. Google Calendar
### Description
- In this work, I have created a simple appointment scheduling chatbot that you can integrate with any platform, though I have used a simple web integration provided by Dialogflow for demonstration.
- It is a simple Appointment Scheduler, it has a backend[NodeJS], it stores data to the database[Airtable], also adds an appointment to Google Calander. One thing, this chatbot is deployed on Heroku so, it does not always live, if the response is empty then refresh the page and try again, please.
